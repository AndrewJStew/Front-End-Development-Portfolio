# Front-End-Development-Portfolio
Repository to house HTML &amp; CSS for my Front-end web development portfolio.

## Task Description

The aim of this task was to reformat to create HTML and CSS from scratch which combine together to create a portfolio page demonstrating the different applications I will create during this bootcamp.

The code itself should incorperate a number of factors, but at it's core several basic principles shoudl apply. These include:

-When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.

-When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

-When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

-When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

-When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

-When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

The motivation behind accomplishing this task is to lay the foundations of a professional portfolio which I will contiue to develop and improve. 

By undertaking this task I have applied my previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and devloped upon that with Flex-Box and CSS Grid. I have also been able to implement some responsive web design. 

##Issues
This build wasn't without it's issues and there are still elements I deem unfinished. 
If given more time I would edit more of the typogrpahy and design. 

I would also add more responsive elements. 

The biggest issue I had was making the Contact Me section align properly. If given more time I would also explore chnaging this. This was orginally a footer, but I found that difficult to make responsive. Hence I incorperated it into the grid.
